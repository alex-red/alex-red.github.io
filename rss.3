This has a lot of advantages in that the RPI consumes very little electricity, and its quite feasible to leave it on 24/7 throughout the year. A much better alternative when you want to access a storage device from your HTPC without needing to leave your desktop or laptop on. With that said, lets move forward on how to set it up. This guide will assume that you are using the latest Raspbian, or a similar distro.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: As with most installs, you should update the package list first, and upgrade if needed.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install
sudo apt-get upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>By default, my Raspbian build did not come with ntfs-3g, so we will need to install that as well:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>:  Now, attach the storage device that you want to use. For the sake of this tutorial, I will be using a windows-formatted file system. You can check the device properties using <code>sudo fdisk -l</code>.</p>

<pre><code>pi@PiServer ~ $ sudo fdisk -l

Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 3947 MB, 3947888640 bytes  
4 heads, 16 sectors/track, 120480 cylinders, total 7710720 sectors  
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes  
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes  
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes  
Disk identifier: 0x000c7b31

        Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/mmcblk0p1            8192      122879       57344    c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)
/dev/mmcblk0p2          122880     7710719     3793920   83  Linux

Disk /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107861504 bytes  
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 60801 cylinders, total 976773167 sectors  
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes  
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes  
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes  
Disk identifier: 0x209e4386

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1            2048   976769023   488383488    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the device I will be using is a 500gb drive, recognized as HPFS/NTFS/exFAT. I wouldn't recommend a unix file system simply because it would not be compatible with windows devices should your Pi ever go down or if you want to take the storage device somewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now we should make the mount locations for the drives to be mounted on. This is simply a directory that you create on the Pi.</p>

<pre><code>sudo mkdir /mnt/500GB
</code></pre>

<p>I will call the mount folder 500GB for simplicity sake, but you can name the folder whatever you wish.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: To actually mount the device to the location we have to edit the fstab file in /etc/fstab. This is how the OS knows where to mount the individual drives on bootup.</p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/fstab  
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>Nano</strong> is my built-in text editor of choice, some may prefer <strong>Vim</strong> (vi)</em></p>

<pre><code>proc            /proc           proc    defaults          0       0  
/dev/mmcblk0p1  /boot           vfat    defaults          0       2
/dev/mmcblk0p2  /               ext4    defaults,noatime  0       1
# a swapfile is not a swap partition, so no using swapon|off from here on, use  dphys-swapfile$
</code></pre>

<p>You should receive something similar to that, assuming you are on a new install of raspbian. Now we simply add our new device at the end of the text file.  </p>

<pre><code>proc            /proc           proc    defaults          0       0  
/dev/mmcblk0p1  /boot           vfat    defaults          0       2
/dev/mmcblk0p2  /               ext4    defaults,noatime  0       1
# a swapfile is not a swap partition, so no using swapon|off from here on, use  dphys-swapfile$
/dev/sda1 /mnt/500GB ntfs-3g defaults 0 0
</code></pre>

<p>You saw from the fdisk output that /dev/sda1 was where your storage device was connected, and /mnt/500GB was the mount point we created. Ntfs-3g is simply the file system we want to mount it as. It will not work if it is not a compatible file system.</p>

<p>After you have added the last line, use Ctrl + X to exit, and Y to confirm the changes to the file.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: To test if everything works, we can use:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount -a

followed by:

ls /mnt/500GB  
</code></pre>

<p>which should display all of the files within the device.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Now, to share this drive across the network, we are going to use Samba.</p>

<p>To install:  </p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install -y samba  
sudo apt-get install -y samba-common-bin

To configure:

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf  
</code></pre>

<p>And find this line:  </p>

<pre><code>[global]

## Browsing/Identification ###

# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of
   workgroup = WORKGROUP
</code></pre>

<p>We want to change WORKGROUP to HOME if we are using Windows 7/8, or leave it if it's XP.</p>

<p>Now, to add the new drive as a source, append to the end of the file:  </p>

<pre><code>[media]
path = /mnt/500GB  
writeable = Yes  
</code></pre>

<p>There are a lot more permissions for samba that you can mess around with, but this will simply let those who access the drive read/write. You can set the drive to read only if you'd like, simply switch writeable = Yes to writeable = No. This will mount a shareable directory named 'media' on your network.</p>

<p>Now exit and save.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Restart the samba service</p>

<pre><code>sudo service samba restart
</code></pre>

<p>And now to connect to the device from our windows system, we will need to add a user to Samba, use:</p>

<pre><code>sudo smbpasswd -a pi
</code></pre>

<p>which will add a user 'pi' and prompt you for a password. This may not be necessary depending on how your Pi is set up.</p>

<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: Connect!</p>

<p>So, using Windows 8, I was able to detect the Pi by default under networks. You should be able to log into the Pi using your normal login</p>

<p><img src='http://my-ghost-blog.com/content/images/2014/Jun/grbYPdK.png'  alt="img" /></p>

<p>If it doesn't show up, then you need to map the network drive manually.</p>

<p><img src='http://my-ghost-blog.com/content/images/2014/Jun/KF1ukp8.png'  alt="img2" /></p>

<p>The credentials will be the user specified in Step 7.</p>

<p>Finished!</p>

<p>So now you have a 24/7 NAS server running on the Pi, perfect for accessing your media files from afar, and from your HTPC (I recommend XBMC, which you can also run on a Pi).</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/raspberry-pi-nas/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">4a53cdac-b8ea-4385-8931-2e95d06d696a</guid><category><![CDATA[raspberry pi]]></category><category><![CDATA[raspberrypi]]></category><category><![CDATA[pi]]></category><category><![CDATA[NAS]]></category><category><![CDATA[server]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex L.]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2014 00:15:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ionic Framework]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>One of the best frameworks to develop mobile web apps is no doubt the <a href='http://ionicframework.com/' >Ionic Framework</a>. Having recently picked up the framework, I found the development experience quite intuitive and user friendly. Coupled with Cordova/Phonegap support, the development of a Android/iOS app, from prototyping to deployment, can be done quickly.</p>

<p>Here is an app that I created in a couple of days with my spare time:</p>

<div>  
<img src='http://i.imgur.com/TAl3ygC.png'  width="50%" style="float: right;" >  
<img src='http://i.imgur.com/5yzT81m.png'  width="50%" ></div>  

<p><center><a href='https://github.com/alexliu03/Modern-Recipe-App' >Link to Github</a> <br />
</center> <br />
You can look at the source code <a href='https://github.com/alexliu03/Modern-Recipe-App' >here</a>. Building the app was a breeze since Ionic is built on top of <a href='https://angularjs.org/' >AngularJs</a>. That means that the structure of the application is focused on two way data binding, and the building of dynamic websites/apps.</p>

<p>AngularJs is a fairly hard framework to learn, but it is definitely worth the time and effort. It allows for websites that are truly dynamic in nature and allows you to create fluid apps that are less clunky and 'hacky' than traditional javascript methods with jQuery. </p>

<p>For example in jQuery, you might want to generate several div elements to append to the document body. This would require you to create divs with <code>$('&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;').html("Hello world!")</code> or <code>$('#element').append("&lt;div&gt;Hello world!&lt;/div&gt;)</code>, and then appending them to wherever. This is entirely tedious considering you would have to track each created element and manually update them whenever you want to change some data.</p>

<p>In AngularJs, you can simply do something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div ng-repeat="i in data"&gt;
    {{i.value}}
</code></pre>

<p>With the corresponding javascript:</p>

<pre><code>$scope.data = [
    {value: 'Hello 1'},
    {value: 'Hello 2'},
    {value: 'Hello 3'}
    ]
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;Hello 1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Hello 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Hello 3&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And of course, if you add a new object to $scope.data, the corresponding DOM changes are applied immediately. This allows you to work strictly with JSON objects when modifying/changing data.</p>

<p>A much saner method.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/ionic-framework/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">dd68d8a9-863a-4146-a74e-2c69df3d0b7e</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex L.]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2014 20:16:59 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
