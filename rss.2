Having recently picked up the framework, I found the development experience quite intuitive and user friendly. Coupled with Cordova/Phonegap support, the development of a Android/iOS app, from prototyping to deployment, can be done quickly.</p>

<p>Here is an app that I created in a couple of days with my spare time:</p>

<div>  
<img src='http://i.imgur.com/TAl3ygC.png'  width="50%" style="float: right;" >  
<img src='http://i.imgur.com/5yzT81m.png'  width="50%" ></div>

</center> <br />
You can look at the source code <a href='https://github.com/alexliu03/Modern-Recipe-App' >here</a>. Building the app was a breeze since Ionic is built on top of <a href='https://angularjs.org/' >AngularJs</a>. That means that the structure of the application is focused on two way data binding, and the building of dynamic websites/apps.</p>

<p>AngularJs is a fairly hard framework to learn, but it is definitely worth the time and effort. It allows for websites that are truly dynamic in nature and allows you to create fluid apps that are less clunky and 'hacky' than traditional javascript methods with jQuery. </p>

<p>For example in jQuery, you might want to generate several div elements to append to the document body. This would require you to create divs with <code>$('&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;').html("Hello world!")</code> or <code>$('#element').append("&lt;div&gt;Hello world!&lt;/div&gt;)</code>, and then appending them to wherever. This is entirely tedious considering you would have to track each created element and manually update them whenever you want to change some data.</p>

<p>In AngularJs, you can simply do something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div ng-repeat="i in data"&gt;
    {{i.value}}
</code></pre>

<p>With the corresponding javascript:</p>

<pre><code>$scope.data = [
    {value: 'Hello 1'},
    {value: 'Hello 2'},
    {value: 'Hello 3'}
    ]
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;Hello 1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Hello 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Hello 3&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And of course, if you add a new object to $scope.data, the corresponding DOM changes are applied immediately. This allows you to work strictly with JSON objects when modifying/changing data.</p>

<p>A much saner method.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/ionic-framework/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">dd68d8a9-863a-4146-a74e-2c69df3d0b7e</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex L.]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2014 20:16:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome to Ghost]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>You're live! Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at <code>&lt;your blog URL&gt;/ghost/</code>. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!</p>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!</p>

<p>Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>shortcuts</em> to <strong>style</strong> your content. For example, a list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Item number one</li>
<li>Item number two
<ul><li>A nested item</li></ul></li>
<li>A final item</li>
</ul>

<p>or with numbers!</p>

<ol>
<li>Remember to buy some milk  </li>
<li>Drink the milk  </li>
<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="links">Links</h3>

<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like <a href='http://ghost.org/' >http://ghost.org</a> - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to <a href='http://ghost.org/' >the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>

<h3 id="whataboutimages">What about Images?</h3>

<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>

<p><img src='https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png'  alt="The Ghost Logo" /></p>

<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>

<h3 id="quoting">Quoting</h3>

<p>Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="workingwithcode">Working with Code</h3>

<p>Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>

<pre><code>.awesome-thing {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="readyforabreak">Ready for a Break?</h3>

<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="advancedusage">Advanced Usage</h3>

<p>There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can  write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.</p>

<p><input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!" /></p>

<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/welcome-to-ghost/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">76bb0a8b-e848-40db-9495-74c3d301f6f7</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alex L.]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2014 09:11:54 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
